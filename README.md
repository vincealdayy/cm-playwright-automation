Installing Playwright
Get started by installing Playwright using npm, yarn or pnpm. Alternatively you can also get started and run your tests using the VS Code Extension.

npm
yarn
pnpm
npm init playwright@latest

Run the install command and select the following to get started:

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript (default is TypeScript)
Name of your Tests folder (default is tests or e2e if you already have a tests folder in your project)
Add a GitHub Actions workflow to easily run tests on CI
Install Playwright browsers (default is true)
What's Installed
Playwright will download the browsers needed as well as create the following files.

playwright.config.ts
package.json
package-lock.json
tests/
  example.spec.ts
tests-examples/
  demo-todo-app.spec.ts

The playwright.config is where you can add configuration for Playwright including modifying which browsers you would like to run Playwright on. If you are running tests inside an already existing project then dependencies will be added directly to your package.json.

The tests folder contains a basic example test to help you get started with testing. For a more detailed example check out the tests-examples folder which contains tests written to test a todo app.

Running the Example Test
By default tests will be run on all 3 browsers, Chromium, Firefox and WebKit using several workers. This can be configured in the playwright.config file. Tests are run in headless mode meaning no browser will open up when running the tests. Results of the tests and test logs will be shown in the terminal.

npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright test

tests running in command line See our doc on Running Tests to learn more about running tests in headed mode, running multiple tests, running specific tests etc.

HTML Test Reports
After your test completes, an HTML Reporter will be generated, which shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests. You can click on each test and explore the test's errors as well as each step of the test. By default, the HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed.

npm
yarn
pnpm
npx playwright show-report

HTML Report

Running the Example Test in UI Mode
Run your tests with UI Mode for a better developer experience with time travel debugging, watch mode and more.

npm
